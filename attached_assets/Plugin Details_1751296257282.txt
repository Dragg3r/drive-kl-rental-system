Drive KL Rental Agreement Plugin (Version 7.1) - Complete Functionality Overview
Author: Akib Nadeem AK13
1. Introduction
The Drive KL Rental Agreement plugin is a complete, bespoke software solution designed to manage the entire car rental process for Drive KL Executive Sdn Bhd. It transforms a standard WordPress site into a sophisticated platform with two distinct interfaces: one for customers and one for staff.
The system handles everything from new customer registration and verification to a detailed multi-step vehicle booking form, automated payment calculation, and secure, watermarked PDF agreement generation. It is designed with a modern, minimal, and fully mobile-friendly user interface, using a flat color scheme for a professional look and feel.
2. Core Components & Setup
To function correctly, the plugin relies on a few key components that are set up automatically.
* Custom Database Table: Upon activation, the plugin creates a new table in the WordPress database named wp_dkl_customers. This table securely stores all customer information, including hashed passwords and account status.
* Required Folders: The plugin automatically creates a /backups/ folder inside its main directory (/wp-content/plugins/drive-kl-rental-agreement/) to store all generated PDF agreements.
* External Library (TCPDF): For PDF generation, the plugin requires the TCPDF library. This must be manually downloaded and placed in a /tcpdf/ folder inside the main plugin directory.
3. User Flows & Functionality
The plugin's user flow is split based on the type of user, ensuring a secure and streamlined experience for both customers and administrators.
A. Initial Role Selection
When any user first visits the page containing the [dkl_rental_form] shortcode, they are presented with a clean, modern interface asking them to identify their role:
* Existing Customer: For returning, approved customers to log in.
* New Customer: For first-time renters to create an account.
* DKL Staff Login: A discreet link that opens a modal window for staff to access the administrative backend.
B. New Customer Journey
1. Registration ("Let's start your Rental Journey")
A prospective renter must first create an account. This is a crucial security and verification step. The registration form requires the following mandatory information:
* Full name as per IC: This ensures accurate identification.
* IC / Passport Number: This is used as the customer's password for future logins. The plugin hashes this value using WordPress's secure wp_hash_password function before storing it, meaning the actual number is never saved in the database.
* Email Address: This serves as the customer's unique username for logging in. The system checks to prevent duplicate email addresses.
* Phone Number: This field is validated to accept numbers and common formatting characters (+, -, ) only.
* Current Address: A text area for the customer's full address.
* Upload IC / Passport Front Page: This is a required field. Upon upload, the plugin automatically performs two critical security actions:
   1. Compression: The image quality is reduced to 80% and resized to a maximum of 1200x1200 pixels. This saves significant server space and ensures fast loading times for staff without sacrificing legibility.
   2. Watermarking: A semi-transparent watermark with the text "FOR DRIVE KL EXECUTIVE SDN BHD USE ONLY" is dynamically applied diagonally across the entire image to prevent unauthorized use or distribution.
2. Account Approval (Instant)
The previous "pending approval" system has been removed to streamline the process.
* Upon successful registration, the customer's account is created in the database with an active status.
* The user is shown a success message and can immediately proceed to the login screen.
C. Staff Dashboard & Administration
1. DKL Staff Login
Staff members access a hidden login modal by clicking the "DKL Staff Login" link. They log in using the secure, hardcoded credentials, in the future there will be an ability to add more usernames and passwords. 
* Username: Akib
* Password: 1234
2. Staff Dashboard Features
Upon successful login, the staff member is taken to a comprehensive dashboard with two main sections:
* Customer Database: This section displays a detailed table of all registered customers, sorted alphabetically by name. It shows their Full Name, Email (Username), Status (with colored pills for easy identification), and includes a direct link to View their IC/Passport photo. It features two key actions:
   * Blacklist / Un-blacklist: A button allows staff to toggle a customer's status between active and blacklisted. A blacklisted customer is blocked from logging in, and their email cannot be used for a new registration. This provides a powerful tool for managing problematic renters.
   * Reset Password: A button allows staff to reset a customer's password. When clicked, a prompt appears asking the staff member to enter a new IC/Passport number for the customer.
* Rental Agreements: This area provides a list of all previously generated PDF agreement files, sorted by the most recent date first. Staff can click to view or download any past agreement for record-keeping and auditing purposes.
D. Existing Customer Booking Flow
1. Login ("Welcome back to Drive KL")
An approved customer logs in using their Email Address as the username and their IC / Passport Number as the password.
2. First-Time Login: Terms & Conditions
The very first time an approved customer logs in, they are presented with a screen displaying the full rental terms and conditions in a scrollable box. The "I Have Scrolled and Agree" button is intelligently disabled. It only becomes clickable after the user has scrolled to the bottom of the text, ensuring they have had the opportunity to review the entire agreement. Once they agree, this preference is saved permanently, and this screen will not appear on subsequent logins.
3. The Multi-Step Rental Form
Once a customer has agreed to the terms, they can proceed with a rental booking via a seamless multi-step form:
* Step 1: Confirm Your Details: This step is pre-filled with the customer's name, email, phone, and address from the database. The fields are read-only to ensure data integrity, and the customer simply clicks "Next".
* Step 2: Car Details: The customer selects a vehicle from a dropdown list. This action triggers several automated functions:
   * Vehicle & Color Selection: The customer chooses from a predefined list of cars and colors.
      * Available Cars & Categories:

         * Porsche 911 (Sports Car)

* Step 3: Vehicle Photos: The customer uploads 7 photos of the vehicle's condition: Front With Customer, Front, Back, Left, Right, Interior/Mileage, and Known Damage. Each upload field shows a live preview of the selected image.
* Step 4: Rental Details: The customer selects the start and end dates for the rental.
   * Automatic Day Calculation: The system instantly calculates and displays the "Total Days" of the rental.
   * Automatic End Time: The "End Time" field automatically mirrors the "Start Time" to ensure consistent 24-hour rental periods.
* Step 5: Payment Details: This section provides a real-time calculation of the total cost.
   * The customer enters the Rental Per Day and Deposit amounts.
   * The form automatically calculates and displays the Rental Subtotal, Deposit, and Grand Total.
   * The customer can enter a Discount amount, which is instantly subtracted from the Grand Total.
   * A mandatory "Upload Payment Proof" field is included.
* Step 6: Finalize & Sign: The customer provides their digital signature on a canvas signature pad. The signature can be cleared with a "Clear" button. The final "Generate Agreement" button is only enabled after a signature has been drawn.
